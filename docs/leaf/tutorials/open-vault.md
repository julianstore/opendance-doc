You have to keep your collateralization ratio in a safe range（above 150%） to avoid [liquidation](https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation). When your collateralization ratio breaches the [liquidation ratio](https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation), your collaterals will be in [auction](https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/tutorials/auction-participation).
