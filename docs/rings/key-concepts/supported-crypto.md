## Will Pando Rings support other cryptocurrencies?

Yes.

The MTG members of Pando Rings will watch the crypto markets and will be looking for new crypto to list them in Rings.

The collateral factor of added crypto will be set to a proper value to reduce the risk. Pando Rings only allow the crypto to be collateralized if the crypto has good liquidity in global markets. If not, the crypto's collateral factor will be set to zero, which means that the crypto will not be collateralized.
