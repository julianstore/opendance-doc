### If you don't have any loans:
Generally, the answer is NO. You gain interest of the assets you supplied and there is no fee you need to pay.

In the very extreme situation though, as assets available to borrow on the market all come from users' supply, if there are bad debts (meaning a loan that is not likely to be paid), there is a chance that you cannot get back the full amount of your supplied assets. However, **it is unlikely to happen** in Pando Rings as liquidation is monitored real-time by liquidating bots (algorithms to execute liquidation) to avoid bad debts from happening.


### If you do have loans:
If the value of your borrowed assets has exceeded your [borrow limit](../key-concepts/glossary.md), you will enter [liquidation](../key-concepts/liquidation.md), losing part or all of your collateral (ie. pledged assets). Of your total supplied assets, the pledged assets are subject to liquidation while your unpledged assets will stay intact.

It is important tht you pay close attention to the [loan risk indicator](../key-concepts/loan-risk-indicator.md) to monitor your loan risk, and keep your collateral safe from liquidation.
