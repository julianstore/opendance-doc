### Key Processes

**Suppling** The process of putting an asset into Pando Rings. As a result, you get rTokens in return, and will earn interest as long as you are supplying the asset.

**Pledging** The process of locking rTokens into the system as collateral to get borrowing power.

**Unpledging** The process of unlocking rTokens from the system and as a result, reducing the borrowing power.

**Withdrawing** The process of getting back an asset from Pando Rings and have it back to your wallet. You will stop earning interest after you withdraw an asset.

**Borrowing** The process of getting a loan in Pando Rings.

**Repaying** The process of paying back your borrowed asset plus the accrued borrow interest.

**rToken** rToken is an ERC-20 token that is essentially a tokenized supply position and can be used as collateral in other liquidity pool or exchanged for other crypto assets.

**Liquidation** When a user's maximum borrow capacity rendered by the total collateral value cannot cover the total loan value, liquidation will happen. In the process, others repay some or all of the user's outstanding borrow on behalf of the borrower and in return receive a discounted amount of collateral held by the borrower.

### Market

**Total Supply** It stands for the total supplied amount of all assets in the markets of the very moment.

**Supply Volume** It stands for the total supplied amount of a specific asset in the market of the very moment.

**Total Borrow** It stands for the total borrowed amount of all assets in the markets of the very moment.

**Liquidity** It stands for the net amount available to borrow of all the markets of the very moment. It equals to Total Supply minus Total Borrow.

**Maximum Market Availability** The amount available to borrow of a specific asset. It equals to the Total Supply of an asset minus the Total Borrow of the same asset.

**24h Supply** It stands for the total supplied amount of all assets in the markets within the last 24 hours.

**24h Borrow** It stands for the total borrowed amount of all assets in the markets within the last 24 hours.

**Supply APY** The estimated annual percentage yield for supplying an asset. The interest is compounded and is calculated every 15 seconds.

**Borrow APY** The estimated annual interest rate of an asset a borrower need to pay. The interest is compounded and is calculated every 15 seconds.

**Collateral Factor** It represents the maximum percentage you can borrow of the value of your pledged asset. It may vary for different assets. Generally, large or liquid assets have high collateral factors, while small or illiquid assets have low collateral factors. Borrowing allowance, or borrowing capacity is determined as (pledged asset * its collateral factor). Each borrow is thus always initially over-collateralized.

### Key Personal Metrics

**Net APY** Net APY(annual percentage yield) reflects the estimatd annual net yield based on the Supply APY and Borrow APY of the very moment. It indicates whether you are making money or losing money at the current APYS.

**Borrow Limit** The maximum amount you can borrow. You can increase your borrow limit by increasing the collateral (pledging more assets).

**Borrow Balance** Borrow Balance = Borrow Limit - Your Borrow. It is the amount you can yet to borrow. If your Borrow Balance is 0, you cannot borrow any asset anymore.

**Borrow/Borrow Limit** It is the percentage of a user's Borrow against the maximum borrow capacity. Itis used to indicate your loan risk.

**My Supply** The total amount of all the assets you have supplied (principal plus the accrued interests).

**My Borrow** The total amount of all the assets you have borrowed (principal plus the accrued interests).

**Total Pledge** The total amount you have pledged as collateral.

**Total Unpledged** The total amount you haven't pledged as collateral.

**Available to Withdraw** The amount of a specific asset you can withdraw. It is the sum of your unpledged asset amount and the pledged amount that is not covering borrows

**Available to Unpledge** The amount of a specific asset you can unpledge. It is your total pledged amount of the asset minus the part covering the outstanding borrow.
