If you want to pay back your borrowed asset, you can go to repay.

You can access it by clicking on the borrowed asset card of the borrow secion on the Me page.

You can drag on the progress bar to decide on the percentage you want to repay.

If you want to pay off the loan, you can drag the progress bar all the way to the right and click on "Payback".

Please be noted that due to the real-time calculation of borrow interest, the actual amount to pay off your Borrow might be slightly higher than the amount shown on the screen. So we will charge you slightly a bit more to make sure the borrow will be paid off, then any excess amount will be returned to your wallet after your payment.
