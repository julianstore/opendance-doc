The Liquidation Ratio is the minimum required collateralization level for each Vault type before it is considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation.

Each Vault type’s Liquidation Ratio is determined by a combination of the collateral’s risk profile and the Stability Fee. There may be multiple Vault types for each collateral, with varying Liquidation Ratios and Stability Fees.

Liquidation Ratio = (Collateral Amount x Collateral Price) ÷ Generated pUSD × 100
