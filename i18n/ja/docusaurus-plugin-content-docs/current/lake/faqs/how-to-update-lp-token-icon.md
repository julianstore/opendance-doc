The icon of LP token is generated by [`4swap-icon-gen`](https://github.com/fox-one/4swap-icon-gen).

Please follow the steps below to update the icon of LP token.

## 1. Submit latest asset icon to Mixin Network

If not, please refer [this tutorial](../tutorials/listing) to submit the asset icon.

Before you can generate the icon of LP token, you need to make sure new asset icon has been deployed to Mixin Network.

To check the status of new asset icon, please visit `https://mixin.one/snapshots/YOUR_ASSET_SYMBOL_NAME` in browser. The webpage will display the asset's information, include the asset's icon.

## 2. Generate the icon of LP token

Download the latest version of  [`4swap-icon-gen`](https://github.com/fox-one/4swap-icon-gen) and build it with:

```bash
go build
```

then run it with:

```bash
./4swap-icon-gen -config YOUR_KEYSTORE_FILE -a0 LP_ASSET_ID -a1 1ST_ASSET_ID -a2 2ND_ASSET_ID
```

その中身には、

- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_FILE` is the keystore file of your account. You can get it from [Mixin Developer Dashboard](https://developers.mixin.one/dashboard).
- `LP_ASSET_ID` is the asset ID of LP token.
- `1ST_ASSET_ID` and `2ND_ASSET_ID` are the asset IDs of the assets you want to generate the icon of LP token. You can get it by visiting `https://mixin.one/snapshots/YOUR_ASSET_SYMBOL_NAME` in browser. The url will change from the symbol to the asset ID.

This command will fetch the latest icons from Mixin Network and generate the icon of LP token in the `output` directory.

for example, if you want to generate a new icon for `sRUM-XIN`, you can run:

```bash
./4swap-icon-gen -config YOUR_KEYSTORE_FILE -a0 a53872c5-b1a3-32da-bbc4-230a7ced69cb -a1 4f2ec12c-22f4-3a9e-b757-c84b6415ea8f -a2 c94ac88f-4671-3976-b60a-09064f1811e8
```

## 3. Submit new LP token icon to Mixin Network
