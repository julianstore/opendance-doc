Pando is an open source project, and we are always looking for translators. If you are interested in translating the docs of Pando, please follow [the instructions here to get started](//docs.pando.im/docs/community/contribute#translation).

A brief description of the translation process:

## Translate at Crowdin

If you're not familiar with Github and the i18n of Pando, we recommend you to use Crowdin to help us translate the docs.

1. [Tap here](https://pando.crowdin.com/u/signup) to sign-up an account of Crowdin
2. Browse the translation status and progress at [Pando's Page at Crwodin](https://pando.crowdin.com/)
3. Get familiar with the Crowdin translation UI, as you will need to use it to translate JSON and Markdown files

## Translate at Github

You can also add your translation by adding [Pull Requests](https://github.com/fox-one/docs.pando.im/pulls) at Github.

Please fork [this repository](https://github.com/fox-one/docs.pando.im) and read the [Contribute Guide](/docs/community/contribute) before adding new translations.
