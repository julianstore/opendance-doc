[Pando](https://pando.im/) is an open-source project. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the growth of Pando.

At the beginning of the project construction, we will additionally provide honors & bonuses for translation contributors.

### Supported Languages

We are initially open for translation in 5 languages: Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German and Spanish.

### FAQs

**Q: Order of formatting tags in the translation is incorrect.** 

A：Probably a modifying syntax error. When you encounter code that modifies the formatting during translation, leave it unchanged. For example: 

`You have to keep your collateralization ratio in a safe range（above 150%） to avoid <strong x-id="1">[liquidation]</strong> (https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation).`

The above is the original text, translated into Korean as follows:

`청산을 피하기 위해 담보 비율 을 안전한 범위( 150% 이상) 로 <strong x-id="1"[>유지해야 합니다.]</strong>(https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/liquidation).`

**Q: Translation contains 1 extra symbol"("**

A: This error usually occurs when Chinese brackets are used, just click Save Anyway.

**Q:what's the differences between translators and proofreaders?**

A: Proofreaders need to review the text saved by other translators. All text should be reviewed and approved by the proofreaders before they are merging to the source code. So the proofreaders will receive more rewards than regular translators. Of course, proofreaders are translator. they can also do the translation.

### Honors and Awards

For all translators, we will give:
1. The NFT of Pando Translator;
2. The translator's name in the Pando documentation and put their Mixin ID and donation link on the official website.

The approved translations will be divided into three categories.

| Type of translation    | Award amount of 1000 words(USDT) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Normal translation     | 30                               |
| Machine Translation    | 10                               |
| proofread translation* | 10                               |

*Specially, if you are good at Japanese, German, Korean, Spanish and can provide valid qualifications to us, you can apply to become a proofreader and receive an additional 10 usdt/1000 words translation benefit.
